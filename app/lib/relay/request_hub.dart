/// Every request in flight, followed over ONE listen (DOCS-contract §4, §9).
///
/// RTDB speaks HTTP/1.1, so a browser holds at most 6 connections to it and
/// every listen keeps one for good. A listen per request let a Home request
/// still running under a Session turn take the app to 6 and starve the next
/// write. One `requests` listen ranged from the oldest followed rid
/// (`orderBy="$key"&startAt`: ULIDs sort by time) serves them all; another
/// device's request in that window rides along, unread.
///
/// `inFlight` counts the requests followed; the shared `rev` listen yields
/// to it (`rev_watcher.dart`), so requests and `rev` share one connection.
/// A request's PUT goes out before its follow starts, while `rev` may still
/// be open: 4 streams and the PUT, 1 connection to spare.
